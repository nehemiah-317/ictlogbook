## Step 5: Create an ICT Staff User (Optional)

4. Scroll down to **Groups**

5. Select **ICT Staff** from available groups

6. Add their first name and last name

7. Click "Save"

8. Logout and login as this new user

9. You'll see they can only view their own records in the admin panel

## Step 6: Explore Features

### As ICT Staff:

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No module named 'accounts'"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the `thirdyear` directory when running commands

### Issue 2: Login redirects to admin instead of dashboard
**Solution:** Clear your browser cookies or use incognito mode

### Issue 3: Groups don't exist
**Solution:** Run: `python manage.py setup_groups`

### Issue 4: Database errors
**Solution:** Delete `db.sqlite3` and run:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py setup_groups
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Next Steps

- âœ¨ CRUD views with forms for the frontend
- âœ¨ List/detail pages for each module
