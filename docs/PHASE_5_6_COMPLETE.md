### Phase 6: URL Configuration ✓
All URL patterns configured and integrated:

```
Main URLs:
- /                         → Dashboard
- /accounts/login/          → Login
- /accounts/logout/         → Logout
- /accounts/profile/        → User Profile
- /admin/                   → Django Admin

Support Records:
- /support/                 → List
- /support/create/          → Create
- /support/<id>/            → Detail
- /support/<id>/update/     → Update
- /support/<id>/delete/     → Delete

Asset Management:
- /assets/                  → List
- /assets/create/           → Create
- /assets/<id>/             → Detail
- /assets/<id>/update/      → Update
- /assets/<id>/delete/      → Delete

Vendor Assistance:
- /vendors/                 → List
- /vendors/create/          → Create
- /vendors/<id>/            → Detail
- /vendors/<id>/update/     → Update
- /vendors/<id>/delete/     → Delete

Thermal Rolls:
- /thermal-rolls/           → List
- /thermal-rolls/create/    → Create
- /thermal-rolls/<id>/      → Detail
- /thermal-rolls/<id>/update/ → Update
- /thermal-rolls/<id>/delete/ → Delete
```

## 🎨 Forms Created

Each module has a custom form with:
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Placeholder text
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Custom clean methods
- ✅ Help text
- ✅ Proper widgets

### Form Validation Rules:
- **Phone Numbers**: Must contain only digits, +, -, and spaces
- **Staff ID**: Minimum 3 characters
- **Quantity** (Thermal Rolls): Must be at least 1

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### Permission System:
1. **@login_required decorator** on all views
2. **Role-based queryset filtering**:
   - Admin users see ALL records
   - ICT Staff see ONLY their own records
3. **Delete permission**: Only Admin can delete
4. **Auto-set recorded_by**: Forms automatically set to current user

### View Logic:
```python
# Example permission check
if is_admin:
    records = Model.objects.all()
else:
    records = Model.objects.filter(recorded_by=request.user)
```

## 📋 Features Implemented

### Search Functionality:
- Case-insensitive search
- Multiple field search (staff name, ID, issues, etc.)
- Uses Django Q objects for OR conditions

### Filtering:
- Status-based filtering
- Filter persists with pagination
- Works with search simultaneously

### Pagination:
- 10 records per page
- Page navigation with Django Paginator
- Search and filter parameters preserved

### Messages:
- Success messages on create/update/delete
- Error messages for permission denied
- Bootstrap-styled alerts

## 🗂️ Files Created/Modified

templates/dashboard.html       ✅ Working quick actions
```

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Test Navigation
- Click on any module in the navigation bar
- Should redirect to list page (will show "Template not found" - Phase 7!)

### 2. Test Quick Actions
- Click "New Support Record" on dashboard
- Should redirect to create form (will show "Template not found" - Phase 7!)

### 3. Test URL Access
Visit these URLs directly:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/support/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/assets/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/vendors/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/thermal-rolls/

You'll get "TemplateDoesNotExist" errors - **This is expected!**
We need to create templates in Phase 7.

## ⚠️ Expected Behavior Right Now

When you click on navigation or quick action buttons:
```
TemplateDoesNotExist at /support/
support_records/list.html
```

**This is CORRECT!** ✅

The views are working perfectly. We just need to create the HTML templates.

## 📊 Progress Update

**Phase 5 & 6: 100% Complete!** 🎉

- ✅ 4 complete form classes
- ✅ 20 view functions (5 per module)
- ✅ 4 URL configuration files
- ✅ Main URL routing
- ✅ Navigation updated
- ✅ Dashboard links active
- ✅ Permission checks

## 🎯 Next: Phase 7 - Templates!

We need to create templates for:
1. List pages (4 templates)
2. Detail pages (4 templates)
3. Form pages (4 templates)
4. Delete confirmation pages (4 templates)

**Total: 16 templates with beautiful Tailwind CSS styling!**
